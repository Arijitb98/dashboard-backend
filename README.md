## Steps to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arijitb98/dashboard.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd <project_directory>
npm install
```

### 4. Start the Application

Once you've set up the project and (optionally) configured the backend, start the development server:

```bash
node index.js
```
